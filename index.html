      <p class="question">How and why do we create a Facebook Page in advance?
      <p class="answer">Creating your own Facebook Page will give you a www web address you can send people to. It also ensures anyone without Facebook can visit your web page and watch your livestream.</p>

      <p class="question">Can we pay someone to set this up for us?

      <p class="question">Can you summarize how it all works?
      <p class="answer">You’ll be creating your own Facebook Page. You can send your page’s www web address to anyone you choose.

      <p class="question">How many videos can we take and how many viewers can watch at once?
      <p class="answer">There is no limit to how many viewers nor how many videos you can upload. However, no individual video can be longer than four hours.</p>
      <p class="question">How long will the video stay online?
